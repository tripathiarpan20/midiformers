# MusicBERT
[MusicBERT: Symbolic Music Understanding with Large-Scale Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05630.pdf), by Mingliang Zeng, Xu Tan, Rui Wang, Zeqian Ju, Tao Qin, Tie-Yan Liu, ACL 2021, is a large-scale pre-trained model for symbolic music understanding. It has several mechanisms including OctupleMIDI encoding and bar-level masking strategy that are specifically designed for symbolic music data, and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on several music understanding tasks, including melody completion, accompaniment suggestion, genre classification, and style classification.
